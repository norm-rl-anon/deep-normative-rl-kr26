    The Taxi Problem involves navigating to passengers in a grid world, picking them up and dropping them
    off at one of four locations.

    ## Description
    There are four designated pick-up and drop-off locations (Red, Green, Yellow and Blue) in the
    5x5 grid world. The taxi starts off at a random square and the passenger at one of the
    designated locations.

    The goal is move the taxi to the passenger's location, pick up the passenger,
    move to the passenger's desired destination, and
    drop off the passenger. Once the passenger is dropped off, the episode ends.

    The player receives positive rewards for successfully dropping-off the passenger at the correct
    location. Negative rewards for incorrect attempts to pick-up/drop-off passenger and
    for each step where another reward is not received.

    ## Action Space
    The action shape is `(1,)` in the range `{0, 5}` indicating
    which direction to move the taxi or to pickup/drop off passengers.

    - 0: Move south (down)
    - 1: Move north (up)
    - 2: Move east (right)
    - 3: Move west (left)
    - 4: Pickup passenger
    - 5: Drop off passenger

    ## Observation Space
    There are 500 discrete states since there are 25 taxi positions, 5 possible
    locations of the passenger (including the case when the passenger is in the
    taxi), and 4 destination locations.

    Destination on the map are represented with the first letter of the color.

    Passenger locations:
    - 0: Red
    - 1: Green
    - 2: Yellow
    - 3: Blue
    - 4: In taxi

    Destinations:
    - 0: Red
    - 1: Green
    - 2: Yellow
    - 3: Blue

    An observation is returned as an `int()` that encodes the corresponding state, calculated by
    `((taxi_row * 5 + taxi_col) * 5 + passenger_location) * 4 + destination`

    Note that there are 400 states that can actually be reached during an
    episode. The missing states correspond to situations in which the passenger
    is at the same location as their destination, as this typically signals the
    end of an episode. Four additional states can be observed right after a
    successful episodes, when both the passenger and the taxi are at the destination.
    This gives a total of 404 reachable discrete states.

    ## Starting State
    The initial state is sampled uniformly from the possible states
    where the passenger is neither at their destination nor inside the taxi.
    There are 300 possible initial states: 25 taxi positions, 4 passenger locations (excluding inside the taxi)
    and 3 destinations (excluding the passenger's current location).

    ## Rewards
    - -1 per step unless other reward is triggered.
    - +20 delivering passenger.
    - -10  executing "pickup" and "drop-off" actions illegally.

    An action that results a noop, like moving into a wall, will incur the time step
    penalty. Noops can be avoided by sampling the `action_mask` returned in `info`.

    ## Episode End
    The episode ends if the following happens:

    - Termination:
            1. The taxi drops off the passenger.

    - Truncation (when using the time_limit wrapper):
            1. The length of the episode is 200.

    ## Information

    `step()` and `reset()` return a dict with the following keys:
    - p - transition probability for the state.
    - action_mask - if actions will cause a transition to a new state.

    For some cases, taking an action will have no effect on the state of the episode.
    In v0.25.0, ``info["action_mask"]`` contains a np.ndarray for each of the actions specifying
    if the action will change the state.

    To sample a modifying action, use ``action = env.action_space.sample(info["action_mask"])``
    Or with a Q-value based algorithm ``action = np.argmax(q_values[obs, np.where(info["action_mask"] == 1)[0]])``.

    ## Arguments

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    gym.make('Taxi-v3')
    ```

    <a id="is_raining"></a>`is_raining=False`: If True the cab will move in intended direction with
    probability of 80% else will move in either left or right of target direction with
    equal probability of 10% in both directions.

    <a id="fickle_passenger"></a>`fickle_passenger=False`: If true the passenger has a 30% chance of changing
    destinations when the cab has moved one square away from the passenger's source location.  Passenger fickleness
    only happens on the first pickup and successful movement.  If the passenger is dropped off at the source location
    and picked up again, it is not triggered again.

    ## Version History
    * v3: Map Correction + Cleaner Domain Description, v0.25.0 action masking added to the reset and step information
        - In Gymnasium `1.2.0` the `is_rainy` and `fickle_passenger` arguments were added to align with Dietterich, 2000
    * v2: Disallow Taxi start location = goal location, Update Taxi observations in the rollout, Update Taxi reward threshold.
    * v1: Remove (3,2) from locs, add passidx<4 check
    * v0: Initial version release
